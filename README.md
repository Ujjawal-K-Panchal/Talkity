# Talkity - Readme.txt
A primitive Chatbot maker in C++. Uses user interaction to grow and learn. It Can recognize words having numbers as letter 
(eg. h3llo = hello) and then use them in sentences, it can also learn different answers and replies for the same query/message, it can also detect and comprehend if user makes some errors in typing to some degree (eg. understnd = understand, learnig = learning). 

Perhaps the best feature of this very primitive project is that one can manage personalities of their chatbots and even control the inquisitive nature of the chatbot.
